## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project was based on the airline and airport management system. There were 2
types of users:

1) Administrators who were airline employees.
2) Normal consumers looking to book flights.

Adminstrators were capable of querying specific information of the
database that was available to customers. For example, administrators could
assign crewmembers to a certain flight but customers could not. There were also
statistical data that could be queried which is located on the statistics tab. Other abilities of Administrator include deleting and adding flights, and changing customers' checked-in status.

## PURPOSE
FlyAway was designed for further improvement and there are plans for using FlyAway as
a basis for further project.
