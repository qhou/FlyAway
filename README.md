## FlyAway

#Project Description:
The project was based on an airline and airport management system. There were 2
types of users:
1) Administrators who were airline employees.
2) Normal consumers looking to book flights.
Adminstrators were capable to manipulating and querying certain information about the
database that was available to customers. For example, administrators were capable of
assigning Crewmembers to a certain flight but customers were not. There were
statistical data that could be queried as well which is located on the statistics tab. A
number of other functionalities such as deleting and adding flights, changing statuses of
customers such that they are checkedin
or not.
What this project accomplished is that it provides a very good basis for a robust future
project. The project is designed for further improvement and we all plan on using this as
a basis for further project.
